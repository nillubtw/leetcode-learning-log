🔗 LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Approach (Summary)
- Traverse both linked lists
- Convert them into integers
- Add and rebuild the result list

## Complexity
- Time: O(n + m)
- Space: O(n + m)


## Learning Log (Personal Notes)
Thought it was an easy and direct problem judging by the title (was wrong).
I first tried solving it using a normal list-based approach and was confident
when I submitted it, but it failed.

After investigating the error, I realized this problem required proper
linked list logic rather than normal lists. I then studied linked lists
and applied the same idea using node pointers, which worked.
